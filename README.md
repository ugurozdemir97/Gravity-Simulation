# Gravity-Simulation

In this simple program you can create some particles with different masses and observe their behaviours under Newton's law of universal gravitation. You have 5 different particles, you can change their mass using the sliders. There is also a static mass type, these particles never move. You should determine the mass of each particle before running the simulation becase collisions between particles change their masses.

There are two ways to create particles. You can generate static masses positioned randomly using the sliders before running the simulation or you can select the buttons on the header and generate static or dynamic particles with initial speed by clicking and dragging the canvas area after running the simulation. 

You can change the min-max values of sliders in HTML if you wish but too many particles make it difficult for the computer (around 500 particles in total in my case) to calculate all forces on the particles.

The G value can be changed to make the animations faster or slower.

It's not responsive so it may not work properly in mobile or tablet screens and if you resize your browser the canvas size won't be resized. So you should refresh the page after you resize :)
